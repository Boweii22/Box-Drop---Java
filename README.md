# Box Drop Android 🚀📱

**Box Drop Android** is a fun, physics-based demo app built with **Java** using the **JBox2D** physics engine. In this project, you can tap on the screen to drop colorful boxes that follow real-world physics. This project demonstrates how to integrate a physics engine into an Android app and visualize the interaction in real-time.

## Features 🎨
- Physics-based simulation using **JBox2D**.
- Dynamic box creation with randomized colors.
- Real-time gravity and collision effects.
- Multi-language support: Written in **Java**, with a **Kotlin version** on the way.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio** installed.
- Basic knowledge of Android development (Java or Kotlin).
- Clone the repository from GitHub:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Boweii22/Box-Drop---Java.git
  ```

### Running the App
1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Build and run the app on an emulator or a real device with API level 21 or above.
3. Tap anywhere on the screen to drop boxes and watch the physics in action! 💥

### Java Version
The current implementation is written in **Java** and leverages the **JBox2D** physics engine. All the logic for box creation, gravity, and collision handling is implemented in Java.

### Kotlin Version (Coming Soon ⚡️)
The Kotlin version of this project will be available soon for those who prefer Kotlin’s concise and expressive syntax. Stay tuned for updates!

## Installation 📲
To install the app locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Boweii22/Box-Drop---Java.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the app on an emulator or your Android device.

## Usage 💡
- Tap on the screen to generate boxes.
- Watch them fall, collide, and stack based on real-time physics simulation.
- Use the `resetBoxes()` method to reset the simulation.

## How It Works ⚙️
- **JBox2D Physics**: The app uses JBox2D to simulate real-world physics. It creates dynamic bodies for the boxes, applying gravity and handling collisions.
- **Rendering**: Each box is rendered on the canvas with random colors assigned to it. The positions are updated based on the Box2D world simulation step.

## Contributing 🙌
Contributions are welcome! If you want to add features, optimize the code, or switch to Kotlin, feel free to fork the repo and create a pull request.

### Steps to Contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Add a new feature - with your name/github profile'
   ```
4. Push to the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
5. Open a pull request.
